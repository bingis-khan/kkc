# Goals

plus requirements

stuff I can do with the language to not forget how I want programs to look like.


## Makefile replacement

```
  if 'exe' depends-on (['main.c', 'another.c'])
    Sh.run('cc main.c another.c -o exe', al)
```

- static arrays / buffers 
- integer type paramters


## Matrix and AutoGrad

- matrix operations, which means:
- static arrays / buffers
- integer type parameters
- integer type operations


## ASCII / Real Roguelike

- opengl / raylib / sdl support
- matrix operations
- recursive data structures
- bring back environment unions


## Editor / GUI applications / GUI std library

- opengl / terminal / terminfo support (i want to implement this by myself, i don't care about being compatible with real life terminal BRUH)
- handling signals


## HTTP server

- path matching (based on list deconstruction)
- string matching (individual strings)


## AOC 2025 / 20XX?

- general std stuff probably
- better errors


## Bootstrap

- a lot of stuff
